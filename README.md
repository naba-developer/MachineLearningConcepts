# Loss functions
In essence loss function is an optimizing function to find the best sort of parameters for a model which minimizes the loss function.
These are some of the common loss functions encountered in ML
## Mean squared error

## Cross entropy loss

## Hinge loss
# Activation functions

# Optimizers

# Regularization
